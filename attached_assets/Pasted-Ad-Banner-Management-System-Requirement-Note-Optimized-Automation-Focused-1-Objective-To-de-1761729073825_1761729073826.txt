Ad Banner Management System – Requirement Note (Optimized & Automation Focused)
1. Objective
To develop a fully automated Ad Banner Management System for TIME’s digital ecosystem — covering Main Page, Course Page, Webinar Pages, Student Login Pages, and Student Home Page.
The platform should automate the entire workflow from slot creation → client request → approval → payment → banner upload → tracking & expiry management, with integrated notifications and reports.

2. Key Roles and Responsibilities
A. Client
•	Login via Phone Number and OTP.
•	View available ad slots across TIME’s pages (with page name, slot position, dimensions, and sample preview).
•	Raise ad placement request by selecting slot(s) and defining duration (start–end date).
•	Upload banner, Purchase Order (PO), and Proposal Document during the request submission.
Proposal Document Upload:
After selecting slots, the client can upload a detailed proposal document before submitting the request.
•	Receive commercial details shared by TIME Manager (amount, payment type, installment details).
•	Make online payment via integrated Payment Gateway.
•	Option to renew, pause, or extend an active banner.
Post-Approval Uploads:
•	After final approval, the client can raise a new banner upload request (updated creative or version change) from their dashboard.
•	Once uploaded, the Manager, Vice President, and IT Execution Team are automatically notified.
•	The new creative bypasses the full approval chain — only the Manager reviews and confirms it.
•	Upon Manager approval, the IT Team directly uploads the creative, and the VP receives a notification for record-keeping.
•	All such uploads are recorded in version control with timestamps and approval details.
Static Sample Preview:
•	Clients can preview how their banner will appear on different TIME pages using a static sample view environment.
•	These preview pages replicate the actual site layout (without impacting live pages).
•	Clients can verify positioning, dimensions, and aesthetics before final confirmation.
Access performance reports:
•	Total clicks and impressions
•	CTR (Click-Through Rate)
•	Page-wise performance summary

B. Manager
•	Add Clients (GST, Address, Contact details).
•	Define Slot Pricing and Validity Options (full/instalment/pay-later).
•	Block slots manually if client cannot raise a request directly.
•	Review and approve client banners, POs, and re-uploaded creatives.
•	Generate quotation or proforma invoice automatically.
•	Set installment breakup with date and amount.
Creative Edit Access:
•	The Manager can download, modify, and re-upload client-submitted banners or creatives for adjustments (e.g., resizing, text edits, compliance fixes).
•	Version Control: Each modification is stored as a new version, maintaining complete edit history (versioned creative logs).
•	The Manager can view and restore previous versions if required.
•	Once the final creative version is approved, it proceeds through the standard workflow (VP → PV Sir → IT deployment).
New Creative Upload Handling:
•	When a client uploads a new creative post-approval, only the Manager needs to review and confirm it.
•	If approved, the IT Team automatically replaces the old banner.
•	The VP receives an informational alert about the update (no approval needed).
•	This process ensures faster creative updates while maintaining control and accountability.
Re-upload Notifications:
•	Receives automatic notifications when a client uploads a new creative or modified version.
•	Can review, edit, or reject the new submission with comments.
Dashboard includes:
•	Pending approvals
•	Expiring ads
•	Re-uploaded creatives awaiting review
•	Revenue and collection status
•	Slot utilization rate

•	Push approved or manager-approved creatives automatically to the respective slots.
•	Maintain backup banners that replace expired ones automatically.
•	Maintain sample preview pages for each slot configuration — replicating website layouts for client preview purposes.
